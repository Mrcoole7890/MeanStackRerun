Plan: Webchat using mean stack

1) Create a node.js server that, utilizing express.js, supplies connected
    clients with a chat terminal.
    - Probibly will be best if I used Jade (More stackexchange support)
    - Probibly will be best if I used Bootstrap (Because vanilla CSS hurts and
        I dont know sass or that other hip CSS interperetor)
    - Remeber, use mongoDB, i swear if I accidentally use MySQL out of reflex i am gonna have a cow!

2) Before I can be confident with the node.js server code I will need to research mongoDB and Angular...
    - Before even starting this project I will need to read up on Angular
    - mongoDB is hopefully easier to learn than Angular

3) Componets I will need to write:
    - server.js (initialises the node server)
    - index.jade (the html the intergrates with node better than actual HTML)
    - something with angular... Probibly...

4) Step by step plan (Tenative... OOOOH BIG WORDSS)
    -1  Reveiw "a few" videos about mongoDB and Angular
    -2  Program an effective development enviorment for testing
        ~ Make sure I can connect to the server via localhost
        ~ Consider Test Driven development
    -3  Begin writing the server.js
        ~ Attempt to avoid any mongoDB and angular until all
            technoligies I am comfortable with are working.
            This will allow me to isolate errors related to misuse
            unfamiliar technoligies.
    -4  Write index.Jade

    Hopfully this is all I need to do...

    I am pretty tired and after doing a tiny bit of research it seems that
    using mongoDB in a Webchat application will be a shoehorned effort (Prepare for logic errors...).
    Additionlly, the video tutorial I am watching (an hour long, detailing a webchat application)
    has dedicated half of the video to explaining setting up Angular. I would be best suited to
    NOT grind this project in one sitting and take my time researching Angular and mongoDB.
    I would like to get back to this project tommarow. Tonight I would like to contiue binging
    tutorials.
